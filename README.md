# Express Local Auth Template

Starter template for local authentication with validation using passport, express, node and mongodb. The template includes eslint, webpack, node-sass, passport etc. All bundled with config files as well. Some decisions like the use of scss as preprocessor, ejs as template engine, mongoose for odm, eslint for linting have been made to reduce the initial setup time but you can use alternatives as well by changing a few lines of code.
